## Getting Started

- Head to [m3o.com](https://m3o.com) and signup for a free account.
- Browse the APIs on the [Explore](https://m3o.com/explore) page.
- Call any API using your token in the `Authorization: Bearer [Token]` header
- All APIs are available through one endpoint: `https://api.m3o.com/v1/[service]/[endpoint]`.
- Use [m3o-cli](https://github.com/m3o/m3o-cli), [m3o-js](https://github.com/m3o/m3o-js) and [m3o-go](https://github.com/m3o/m3o-go) clients for development

## Quick Start

Grab your API token from the dashboard and try out helloworld. 

### Curl

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $M3O_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "John"}' \
     https://api.m3o.com/v1/helloworld/call
```

Find all the shell examples in [m3o-sh](https://github.com/m3o/m3o-sh)

### Go

Import packages from `go.m3o.com`

```go
import "go.m3o.com/helloworld"
```

Create a new client with your API token and call it

```go
helloworldService := helloworld.NewHelloworldService(os.Getenv("M3O_API_TOKEN"))

rsp, err := helloworldService.Call(&helloworld.CallRequest{
	"Name": "Alice",
})

fmt.Println(rsp.Message)
```

Find all the Go examples in [m3o-go](https://github.com/m3o/m3o-go)

### JS

```
npm install m3o
```

Call helloworld like so

```javascript
const { HelloworldService } = require("m3o/helloworld");

const helloworldService = new HelloworldService(process.env.M3O_API_TOKEN);

// Call returns a personalised "Hello $name" response
async function callTheHelloworldService() {
  const rsp = await helloworldService.call({
    name: "Alice",
  });
  console.log(rsp);
}

callTheHelloworldService();
```
